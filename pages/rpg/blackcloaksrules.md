# Black Cloaks House Rules 
Black Cloaks primarily uses the Shadowdark system developed by Kelsey Dione. Available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wl3Vlp9aC4atjL6neQV3HjJIFHugLn_1/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Modifications and additions to the standard Shadodark ruleset are described below:


## Grit 
Black Cloaks replaces the Luck point system with a Grit point system. Grit points represent your characters ability to overcome sturggles against adversity. 
Each time your character fails a skill check they receive a grit point up to a maximum equal to their character level (minimum 1). Characters may spent grit points to add a +1 to checks and cash in up to three to gain advantage. Other PC's can also contribut to a pool to have PC's 

## Sanity
Sanity represents a character's mental defenses and health. It is taxed by traumatic events, monster's special abilities, and most notably *the dark*. Sanity is equal to your Charaisma modifier (minimum 1)
Sanity increases every level according to class:
* Fighter - 1d4
*Thief - 1d4
* Priest - 1d6
* Wizard - 1d6

When a caster fails their spellcasting check they may put their Sanity at risk to successfully cast the spell. To perform this, caster's make a CHA check (DC = Casting check) -- on a failure the caster takes 1d4 * spell lvl.

Example DC's for Sanity damage:
* DC 9 - particularly gruesome death
* DC 12 - forcing yourself to do something mentally difficult
* DC 15 - moving through the dark 
* DC 18 - moving deeper into the dark

## Sundering and Weapon Quality
Weapons and armor may chip and break with use.
On PC attack rolls a _confirmed_ critical miss degrades weapon quality by 1 increment. A confirmed critical hit on a PC degrades armor quality by 1 increment. Weapons and armor can be of *Crude*, *Good*, *Excellent*, and *Masterwork* quality. Masterwork items require a double crit to degrade. 
When quality drops below crude the item is deatroyed.
