# Black Cloaks History 
---


The Black Cloaks began as a guild of scholars, cartographers, archaeologists, and dungeoneers that  sought out the ruins of ancient civilizations, sunken treasure galleons, and the burial hordes of ancient kings for knowledge, profit, and fame. 
In time, the black cloaks became respected and feared in equal measure and at their height, the black cloaks were the consult and trade partners of kings, archmages, and warlords alike. 
However, as their power grew, so too did their enemies: borders were closed to their passing, information once freely provided now came with conditions or not at all, and kingdoms began to lay claim to the wealth and artifacts that the Black Cloaks had obtained. 
Laws were passed against “Black-Cloaking” to be punishable as thievery or grave-robbing. 
Thus, the opportunities with which the guild was left became increasingly remote and dangerous: the oceans to cross were wider and dungeons deeper darker. 

Today the Black Cloaks are composed of a venerable old guard and an increasingly desperate or daring lot of recruits that show up green in the spring and are usually dead by winter.
It is said now that only the truly pathetic, insane, or foolish mantle the black cloak willingly. 
Many rulers have even made a habit of forcing conscription to the guild hoping the ne’er do well might strike it rich and pay back their debts, make something of themselves, or die in some far off land and spare them the trouble.

## Countries of Khudan

### Doran
A nation which has changed nearly everything but its name over the course of its history. The Doran of old was a small spiritual population clustered around Andoran nestled at the confluence of two rivers lead by religious leaders. And it remained so for many hundreds of years, coexisting peacefully with its neighbors. However, a brush with near destruction by imperially minded neighbors convinced the people and high lama that they must adapt or be destroyed.
Andoran dispatched scouts and scholars around the continent  to learn how best to meet this new threat and the nation gathered and applied knowledge from around the continent. Slowly Doran transitioned from defensless theocracy to a  major military power led in tandem by the supreme general and the theocratically appointed Emperor.  The Dorani rejoiced in their newfound strength and national pride, but the Dorani did not foresee that the newly fashioned war machine would require constant fuel. 
Soon Doran began gobbling up its neighbors in acts of outright aggression, growing its territory to 
many times its original size, soon the theocratic leaders were overthrown by the military and the wars raged for hundreds of years during which countless lives were lost, cities were sacked, and cultures were erased. Eventually Doran had assimilated the entirety of the lowlands stretching from the western sea to the mountains of Uro's Spine and from the Buckler mountains which shielded the Umbar to the Northern Cloudpeaks which the Ysgr guarded fiercely. When enemies without became impractical to fight, and with a growing desperation to demonstrate a need for its existence, the military turned inward and began campaigns against the elves who were once an integral part of the theocratic part of Dorani society but had transitioned to vocal critics of the imperialistic government. Over the next 30 years Doran declared all elves enemies of the state, and attacked them with propaganda and military might. Soon the Dorani military has all but exterminated the Elves within its borders . 
Over the next generation the military began to stagnate and the people grew to oppose it's broad powers. A Republic was formed with each province chosing senators to represent them in the capital city of Dan Kadar. Today Doran has settled into a relative peace with military industry being turned to civic technology and infrastructure.  Modern Doran is somewhat of a hodge-podge of races and cultures as the recent expansion has assimilated so many formerly disparate peoples. There are still many who would see Doran destroyed as retribution for the many people and cultures damaged or destroyed by the hundreds of years of war but for every detractor there are  many who are enthusiastic about their new Dorani citizenship.  All races are now welcome but humans dominate by a large margin. The forests of Doran once contained most of the Elves on the continent but the elf campaigns saw major population centers destroyed. Although many elves may still live in the massive forests they now do so in secret. Historically the close proximity of elves and humans makes half-elves and those of eleven descent very common but anti-elf sentiment is still prevalent and most keep their ancestry to themselves.
​
### Tadros​
The oldest country on the continent of Khudan and has an appropriately long and complex history. Oral tradition suggest that this first settlement was a comprised of a small group of settler somewhere in the vicinity of Oso. Although their continent of origin is not known, scholars believe that these early Tadrosi are likely to have been driven off their original course by a storm and ended up travelling across the eastern sea to Khudan. The theory assumes that despite the meager landscape of Tadros, these intrepid settlers could not return home and so worked the land and plied the waters off the coast.  

Despite the scarce and irregular rains, land-based explorations away from Oso were complicated by the nearly inhospitable climate of the Tadrosi steppe and mountain chains to the west, the frozen wastes of Ysrgr to the north and the sea to the east. Still expeditions to the south by land and Sea continued for some time and slowly Tadros began to grow physically and culturally. 

Over time, Tadrosi culture became obsessed with water; it’s flow, it’s seasonality, and it’s important to life. These skills blended well with the native goblins and particularly Orcs who revered the land and sea in a religious sense. A friendly relationship led to a long history of exchange between the cultures including the development of methods of securing water for the long term. Elaborate canals, cisterns, and underground piping were created to capture the fresh water that would normally erupt from the sky and pour into the ocean during flash floods and fields of enormous moisture traps were designed and built to harness water carried by the maritime breeze. To this day much of tadrosi society is conducted beneath the earth  and the largest cities often contain as much infrastructure underground as above it. 

In addition to their knowledge of the natural world, the Orcs shared their knowledge of the four primordials and the Tadrosi were quick to incorporate these new gods into their religious beliefs. Today most Tadrosi are strong believers in the power of the primordials and they are the basis of religious life in the nation. Mariners frequently have mermaid avatars of Eloa or Storm clouds representing Aea tattooed on them, warriors pray to Shaír before battle, and farmers thank Ur for their harvest for their harvest ever year at the festival of the moons. 

The next great event in the tadrosi progression (and by extension all of the Old Races) was again brought on by the Orcs who showed the tadrosi how to access the magical energies concentrated in the area. The tadrosi took to the manipulation and use of magical energy rapidly and it quickly became a part of their society. Only a few centuries later the great mage Ksaran Narakess would discover the Oso locus laying the groundwork for a magical renaissance of culture and technology. However, many also blame Narakess for the cavalier attitude toward magic which led to the later magical disasters that would alter the course of history. 

As most of the data has been collected from oral tradition, and archaeological inference the exact date of the cataclysm is unknown  but the scholarly consensus states that somewhere in the vicinity of 750 thousand years ago a great magical force was unleashed on the city of Oso and may have stretched far beyond its borders. The city and its population was almost entirely destroyed. However, goblinoid oral traditions contain mentions of strange small creatures without claws or sharp teeth appearing among them. Thus, it is thought that groups of tadrosi were transported  to far flung corners of Khudan. The majority of those transported are likely to have perished shortly thereafter but it is thought that the remaining Old Races (humans, elves, and dwarves) are derived from the surviving groups. 

After such a large setback Tadros was sent into a dark age of small fishing communities primarily along the coast of the eastern sea. The orcs, having witnessed the calamity and wary of the consequences of assisting the tadrosi, left them to their own devices. Of course, over time the settler of tadros reclaimed their heritage and rebuilt Oso but the process is thought to have been around 10 thousand years in the making. In spite of this history or perhaps because of it Tadors today is the defining force in what is considered the eastern style of magic and the Oso Arcanum is widely regarded as the most prestigious of those schools. Over the years the arcanum has defined every aspect of Tadrosi life, discovering new applications of magic and propellgin Tadros to a major world power. The Archanum and the council of the magi are now the seat of government for the country. 
Magic permeates every aspect of tadrosi life and the government is no exception. Tadros is ruled from Oso by a council of magi. These councilors are chosen by city representatives elected by representatives of the arcanum democratically and serve a 5 year term as Archmagi before rotating. Magi can only be removed by other  Magi and many serve for life. Thus Oso is the seat of both enormous governmental power and magical force. The system has served Tadros well as a whole and led to a country with incredible wealth.  Much of the Andori conquests were fueled by tadrosi capitalists: "Andori arrows are fletched with Tadrosi silver".

Looming large in Tadrosi society are the problems of corruption and an economy addicted to magic. The ancient locus discovered near Oso fueled its rapid expansion and implosion and many see this as a parable for modern Tadros. The current crop of Magi believe that aggressive expansionist policies which secure and safely tap loci found around the continent are in the best interests of tadrosi citizens but many are in vocal opposition to these policies. In either case the use and export of Khudaros, a sort of magical energy which can be used to refresh a magic-user or restore the health of the ailing, is a massive business.

### Munar
A rugged landscape characterized by rocky terrain, jagged coastline and dramatic mountains. The people of Munar survived by being as tough and wild as their environment but also by forging intense bonds with each other. Here the strength of a man's word, sword arm, and back are weighed in equal measure. The populace is organized into clans which are loosely governed by an Alderman who is chosen at birth and trained to be as selfless and educated as possible. Each Alderman is also afforded a seat at the council of Mun where larger decisions are made. The geography of Munar makes flat arable land a rarity. Thus Munar has always had a sizable maritime presence. Historically, raiding the western coasts of the nearby mainland was a common practice and a way to substantiate what little resources the island had.
The ancient history of Munar is primarily driven by conflict with Ysgr whose raids into Ysgr land across the Styvyr straits and the shining sea have defined the people of the northwest. Even one of the dominant religions of Munar has it's roots in the deliberations of Aerodyn, an ancient warlord who had a revelation of the divine after losing everything to the orcish raiders. Like the animists of Ysgr, Aerodynites consider all life to be part of the same whole and all minds to be expressions of a great interconnected universal consciousness. (though religious scholars believe this may have simply been a repackaged Illusi faith). Today Aerodynism is the dominant religion and the Munar are spiritually advanced with a powerful sense of connection to all things resulting in a generally compassionate society. 
Eventually many Munar raiders settled in what would become the western coasts of Ysgr and Doran. Today the Ysgr and Munar have become allies primarily driven by their mutual distaste for the Dorani to the south. 
Marriages between Orcs and humans are probably more common here than anywhere else in Khudan but so too are those between elves, dwarves, and even goblins. As a result the genetics of the area are highly mixed and most simply refer to themselves as Munari. Recent loss of territory from Dorani incursions has only increased the importance of maritime trade and naval power. Thus Munari are some of the more common fishermen, whalers, traders, sailors, and privateers. Navies aroudn the world are bolstered by Munar seamen and the best even still the schools of navigation and oceanography can be found on the island. The Munar are fond of saying that they have more knowledge of the nature of the sea than the Tadrosi of magic. In truth, the people of Munar are a well educated society with many Alderman reachign the ranks of the religious and civic scholars of Tadros. Unlike Tadros, Munar has been content to maintain its borders, a policy which some decry as unrealistic in an increasingly militaristic world. 
​
### Ysgr
Ysgr is a land dominated by the cold. The jagged northern coast is a maze of Fjords and glacially carved valleys surrounded by a sea of shifting ice. The land here is steep, rugged, and beautiful. Farther inland is a vast expanse of tundra and longest stretch of continuous grassland on the continent. Finally the tundra gives way to the massive Bristlecone Taiga; a frozen forest which stretches unbroken from the eastern to the western sea. This tremendous expanse of dark green foliage ends at the foot of the cloudpeak mountains where the altitude reduces the altitude of the treeline to a few hundred feet here a massive steppe dominates before the cloudpeak mountains reach the sky. The extremely short growing season combined with the scarcity of arable land makes farming virtually impossible. This has led to a highly dispersed people with very low density everywhere except the western coast. Nomadic reindeer herders, hunter gatherers, and small fishing villages dominate the country outside of these settlements. The end of the mountains marks the end of modern Ysgr Sovereignty. However, Ysgr was once several times it current size covering nearly all of the Dorani shield. 
A thousand years ago the country was united by the great army of Yvg Ysgr for which the nation is now named. Ysgr is said to have led an uncountable number of reindeer cavalry through the mountains and into the valleys of the south, sweeping over the entire continent like a great wave. But was Yvg a conqueror and not a statesman and his empire fell apart nearly as quickly as it was assembled. A strong warrior culture runs through the country to this day though this has taken the form of athletic competition, traditional arts, and ceremonial rites of passage. 
Due to the lack of infrastructure, the people are closely connected with the nature and druidcraft,  ancestor worship, and shamanism are widely practiced. Although the Ysgr do not have a formal religion most share a common set of concepts and rituals that reinforce their shared heritage many based on reindeer riding, hunting, bushcraft, and other traditional pastimes.
Although Orcs and Goblins pre-dated all humanoid settlers, they were eventually joined by the dwarves who migrated north from the Cloudpeak mountains and whose naturally hardy constitution made them resistant to the biting cold and whose love of the mountains saw them settle all over the cloudpeak range. Slowly the dwarves learned to adapt to the snow and ice and built the city of Ntuk in the west. Humans and elves eventually followed to trade and share and explore the new land. Humans intermingled and even interbred with dwarves but the elves kept to the Taiga. Despite a migration of elves to the Taiga after the Elf Purges of Doran the forest's vastness and hostility has obscured the true number of elves within it since the beginning. 

### The Aongh
The Isles of Aohng are a string of volcanic islands at the southern tip of the continent. The inhabitants are primarily fisherman with the majority of agriculture taking place on Ahngo the largest island and the largest city Nao Aongo.  Although a warrior culture has always been a part of Ahngo society they were not prepared for economic takeover.
​Still, the Aohng often trade their exotic goods with the rest of the continent with Tadros usually acting as the intermediary. Despite their good nature, Aohngo are primarily human and intensely superstitious resulting in a subtle distrust of outsiders and other races. Tadros' incursion has not helped in this regard. The Isles of Aohng have a diverse religious beliefs with several animist, monotheistic, and polytheistic religions native to each island.

### Zidan
is known as the cloud kingdom as nearly all of its settlements are perched along the massive mountain range known as the Spine of Ūro and some in the northern cloudpeaks. Their people are resilient and resourceful and comprised of master miners, smiths, architects, builders, and, farmers who transform the jungle-covered  mountains into terraced fields with homes and roads carved  into the rocks themselves. 
Zidan is not the most heavily populated nation but their cities are extremely dense and all races are welcome. Among the Zidan humans are less common but still make up a sizable portion of the populace.
The Zidatan are extremely pragmatic, logical thinkers and among the most common religions is a passive agnostic materialism that eschews the worship of any particular god on the grounds that they are most likley unknowable. 

### Ulangatun
An independent City state surrounded by Umbar territory on the southern tip of Kudahn. Manages to maintain sovereignty through clever trade and a host of historically beneficial marriages. Initially Ulangatun was a city of Umbar and the the tropical getaway of royalty but then becoming wealthy enough in its own right to become a sovereign city. Ulangatun is primarily populated by Humans, Gnomes, and Goblins. The city has an unmatched advanced good economy where raw materials are imported and master craftsmen pump out some of the finest clockwork mechanisms, jewelry, silks, and art in the world. 


## Religions of Kudahn

#### Compiled by  Qassin  Dohar , Sc.N.P. , Dept. of Comparative Religion, Oso Arcanum

### Primordial Worship
Between the cities and deserts among the sagebrush and scrublands of the east live the practitioners of the oldest religion in Tadros and potentially the continent. Practitioners believe that the energy of the primordials is thought to suffuse all of nature. Primordialists see the entirely of creation as being literally comprised of the four essences. To primordialists the dualism of Ngan-Shair and magic-focus of Kūdism seem overly simplistic.
​Whether Primordial worship was brought to Kudahn from across the Iboro Sea or evolved from the goblinoid animism (and thus is more ancient) is an on-going topic of research but similarities abound. However, the ancestor worship and emphasis on spirits and ever conscious entities is rejected in place of a more physical understanding of the universe. The primoridials are:
#### Ur
Domain of solids, earth,  mountains, strength, tradition, death, family, winter. Simply symbolized by a circle symbolizing stone or more complexly represented by concentric circles. 
#### ​​Eloa
Domain of the ocean, change, tranquility, rebirth, inspiration, growth, spring . Symbolized by a wave and more complexly by vast interlocking patterns.
#### Aea
Doman of the sky; gasses, freedom, weather, fall,  art, creativity, Simply Symbolized by a gust of wind and more complexly represented by swirling chaotic patterns that never repeat
#### Shaír
God of passion, fire, poetry, sex, love, anger, light, the sun: Simple symbol is a triangle more complex symbols: red disc surrounded by orange flames

### Illūs
Illusi are common in the north, northeast and east of Doran where elves and humans historically intermingled. Practiced by widely among the elves and the ancestral Dorani.
Those that believe in the dream of Illūs believe that through meditation and deliberate action ones soul may be brought closer to true peace. If enough souls are brought to peace then the entire planet may reach perfect balance. Illus represents a state of true understanding which permeates all beings. A state of mind which is unshakable in its serenity. Named after an ancient elf: Illusani- thought to have gathered a host of humans and the elves brought them to the mountains and revealed her understanding. True neutral- like Nature, Illus represents the natural rhythm of life, seasons, and the circle of life and death. Believes that there is no meaning of life and all beings should simply be.  Conscious beings should strive for tranquility and contentment.  All beings have spirits which are constantly recycled back into the earth and newborn creatures at random like nutrients. An individual is a simple vessel which holds a temporary sentience. The goals of the Illusi is to do as little harm as possible to the world around them and help others to achieve tranquility. They are often criticized as too passive or impractical. Illusi are not enterprising or nation building. Illusi are not defenders as they see the loss of innocents or injustice as an eddy in a great cosmic river. 

### The Divine Family
Worship of a family of gods comprised of two parents and two children is common in the western portion of the central shield of Khudan. The family represents all the virtues of mankind in different forms. Each god embodies particular virtues but does not necessarily establish  the ideal form of that particular age or gender. By splitting the ideals, amongst four beings the divine family acts as a symbolic statement that no being (even gods) can contain all virtues and that many virtues can become  vices when taken to extremes. 
In the tradition of the divine family the universe, celestial bodies, and life forms are seen as eternal, existing without beginning or end. The family is said to live amongst the celestial bodies with which they are associated making visits to earth when needed. Though many believe in their physical existence and domain over reality, the divine family also constitute characters in hundreds of folk tales and thus are an important component of everyday life both in and out of these enclaves of steadfast belief. Often the divine family interacts with “Demons” these creatures are typically humanoid but can also manifest as animals and more abstract concepts. The term demon does not connote an evil disposition but rather a minor deity which often serves to counterpoint one of the families virtues or extract a family members vices. Sometimes demons represent forces of nature, luck, or some other unexplained phenomenon. 
This is a simplified representation of the most common modes of worship of the divine family however, the expansion of humanity throughout the central Khudan shield has left many ethnic groups to adapt and alter the faith and numerous splinter traditions have arisen. Some have developed traditions focused on the worship of particular family members and relegating other family members to the status of demons. Others have elevated particular demons to deity status or developed entire faiths focused on a single entity.  
A variation of the divine family popular in the northeast integrates the four deities into primordial worship by viewing the four family members as anthropomorphic avatars of the four primordials. This is likely from cultural integration with Orcs and to a lesser extent elves, among the mountains. Scholars point to the numerous similarities between the divine family and the primordial four as evidence for a common ancestor. These scholars also name this religion among the oldest in Andor. 

#### Yara
female aspect of nature, fertility, wisdom, the moon, the home, the harvest, childbirth, the hearth, summer, cooking, and the moon (healing, tranquil) Lust, spite, jealousy, indifference, apathy, sadness , blindness 
####  Sernos
male aspect of nature, strength, passion, duty, warriors, summer, Work, crafting, protection. winter And the sun  (resolute, consistent, powerful) Power seeking, hatred, stubbornness, gluttony, deafness

### Kūdism
​is a monotheistic religion focused on magic (Kūdahros). Khidists believe that magic is likely a sentient force and the creator of the cosmos. Unlike many other religions, anthropomorphizing Kūdahros is almost never done and considered absurd if not disrespectful.
Kūdahros is thought to exist on another plane or series of dimensions -- in a way that is incomprehensible to the standard conscious mind. The deeply faithful often use herbal or arcane psychedelics and other stimulants to reach heightened states of understanding and glimpse the mind of god. Among these people a touch of madness is often considered a gift. Unlike other religions Kudists believe that the more magic is practiced and utilized the more connected to Kūdahros the individual grows and in turn the more powerful Kūdahros grows. It is believed that most magic in the universe is contained, locked-away, and inert. Freeing this energy hastens the universes destiny to be composed purely of arcane energy.
To Kūdists there is nothing more divine than pure magical energy known as Kūdahros but it is believed that magic infuses everything. Practicing magic is akin to prayer and the most powerful wielders of Kūdahros are venerated and revered. Kūdists are concentrated in cities and the coast of Tadros and Oso is their most important city.

### Ngana-Shaír
is a Dualist religion concentrated in the deserts of Tadros. Ngana-Shaír is thought to be an evolution of Orcish style animism brought east and south from across the mountains and applied to desert life. This religion focuses on the interplay of fire and water. These elements are seen in nearly all of life's dualities: the sun and the moon, drought and rain, day and night. Passion, and restraint, action and patience, emotion and logic.
There are many demi-gods and demons and all are thought to exist as part of the dichotomy of fire and water. Although some demi-gods are explicitly evil or good most of the conflict that the gods and man face is a consequence of the contrasting desires of the two halves. Thus, conflicts amongst conscious beings are often viewed through this lens.

### Ærodynites
Ærodyn (AIR-oh-din). 
Long ago some say as many as 2,000 years ago when the wars between Munar and Ysgr were in full swing there was a great warlord from a line of famous warriors known as Ærodyn son of son of Ærod. The Orcish armies would cross the northwest sea and flood the shores of Munar, sacking villages and laying waste to the people. They claimed that the land was stolen from them but the Munari believed they had always been here. Thus the wars continued. Every fall the Orcs would stream south from their frozen homes in search of arable land. After a successful battle defending their homes Ærodyn led the Munari across the sea to strike back at the Orcs. He found their frozen miserable villages tucked between the thorny lines and mountain caves and moved from one to another burning  them until the army needed rest. But during their rest the Orcs mounted a counterattack that overwhelmed the Munari. Ærodyn had never imagined so many Orcs could even survive in such a harsh environment. The Munari were obliterated and the entire army lost. Ærodyn woke  half frozen and covered in blood. He walked through the fields of the dead to his ship and set sail back home. But upon reaching Munar he found the Orcs had raided the mainland in his absence and taken everything. 
In a fit of despair Ærodyn entered the forest with no equipment or food intended to die at nature’s hand. He found a grove of red maple and sat to meditate until he faded from this life. It’s unknown how long he remained in this state but it is said that at some point in half-mad, half-starved stupor Ærodyn ate the trees bark and leaves and fungus growing on the trunk. 
It is said that Ærodyn came to understand his utter meaninglessness. He saw nature and the cosmos unclouded by the self. He saw all matter, all life, and all consciousness as waves in an endless ocean: minds and realities constantly surfacing and being reabsorbed. 
When he awoke he began carving his revelations on nearby stones and kept carving until his dying breath. It is said that animals would visit the site and continue his work and some believe that Ærodyn was able to transfer his consciousness to bears and raccoons. Now on the solstice and equinox it is said that those with minds unclouded by untruth may beseech him for guidance. And the stones he carved have been formed into a large temple around the red maple grove. 
However the incursions of Andor made it necessary to hide the temples location to protect it and the last confidant was killed over 60 years ago. 

### Ysgr Animism
Ysgr have many scattered traditions with aspects unique to each clan however in most cases all creatures and some forces of nature or natural structures like mountains, rivers, or forests are though to have spirits. Some benevolent and some malignant. The spirits of Ancestors are especially important as they can communicate more easily with living creatures. The spirit world is seen as equal to the material world but difficult to access for many. As spirits in the spirit world age they become increasingly less conscious and more abstract until they become pure energy which can only reassemble under extreme circumstances or by combining with other spirits will. Some spirits may have such a powerful force of will that they are thought to endure much longer or recruit others to their cause. 
​
Most Ysgr Animists believe that fear is the root of all evil and fear stems from spiritual ignorance. Thus eliminating fear,  understanding the mind, and the natural world will lead to peace for your spirit and prevent it from fearfully wandering the world. As a result, priests are often warriors as well. The spirits and material beings are in an eternal cycle. The sprint world of accepted newly liberated spirits which have died and then injects them into newborns again. Adherents believe that there is a finite quantity of energy in the world and therefore a finite number of living beings which can occupy it. Throwing the world out of balance could cause permanent damage to this balance or create a new balance. They even ice that different worlds have existed where spirits were dominant or much less energy was available. 


### Huuna
The southern islands contain myriad religious traditions. One of the largest is called ”Huuna” Meaning truth in Yagkuuna (a major language of the Aongh). The Huuna creation myth follows: Two primary gods Raurani and Gulanu’u were a single entity of pure energy that were split at the formation of the universe. Many other such beings exist but they are scattered throughout the skies as stars now. Raurani was furious at the split and became so angry that he created lava. As his anger cooled it transformed to solid acceptance forming land. Gulang’u cried instead and his tears created the oceans themselves. Where his tears met Raurani's hot land steam was formed. Raurani collected the steam to make the sky. Gulanu'u spent untold time creating the many creatures and plants of the sea to take distract him from the sadness of his split but Raurani breathed life into them by channeling his passion into Gulang’u’s work. Overtime the creatures transitioned to land. Eventually the brothers decided that they should allow their creations to roam freely and the brothers would watch from their new sky home becoming the sun and moon. The sun would continue to influence life and the moon would control the oceans.
Raurani- volcano god considered responsible for land, time, the sky, and giving life. 
Gulang’u - whale god and creator of the sea, sculptor of all lifeforms starting in the sea.

### Ulunism
Common goblin Religion with an entire Pantheon of Gods primarily associated with nature. Thought to be descended from Huuna since chief among these gods are the moon and sun. However unlike Huuna the moon is often given a male aspect and the Sun a female aspect. Goblin society is often matriarchal, reflected by the divine organization chief sun goddess and her husband the moon god. 

### Zidatan Agnosticism
A practically agnostic religion of Zidan. The people of Zidan content that a god may have created the cosmos but make no claim to have any idea about what sort of god this might be, why they would do such a thing, The Zidatan believe that if a being was capable of creating the cosmos it is so unimaginably powerful that it's desires are likley completely unknowable and we most likley matter very little to it thus, whether we worship it or not is likley immaterial. 


## Languages of Kudahn
#### Hedial Mertashar, Professor of Linguistics, University of K'uvu
### Andros
The new lingua Franca for the majority of civilized cultures in Khudan. Andor’s massive economy and influence have made the language common throughout the continent but especially in Andor and its neighbors. Uses Zidatan and Tadrosi characters and is a sort of hodge podge of a language allowing most to understand at least some andros even if they cannot speak it. Semi Agglunative (like German).
Language Influences -Mashup of Kurdish and Dutch,words are stuck together to form compounds and capitals are left in.

#### Tadrosi
is descended from the old tongue brought from across the eastern iboro sea. Due to the dominance of Tadros in the sphere of magic most magical, scientific, and philosophical texts, scrolls and other works are written in Tadrosi. Tadrosi uses a distinct alphabet which predates the much more widely used Gundatan alphabet though its age relative to the Grygr bone script syllabary is unknown. Modern Tadrosi is descended from ancient Tadrosi but the cataclysm known as “The Undoing” destroyed much of the collected works in the ancient language and its speakers. Thus, modern Tadrosi Is thought to have diverged significantly though estimates vary though some words and grammatical structures have been shown to have been conserved through archaeological evidence of unearthed fragments of ancient Tadros found around the continent. 
Example words: Oso - Delta, Jua- sunbeam, Gbukhu, Yekwa, Khenira, Taurek, Khe Nussek, Nessar, Ubna
Language Influences: -Basque, Yoruba, Egyptian, Moroccan

### Ka Kolantani
Language of the elves, widespread due to cultural exchange between disparate tribes. Some dialectical drift but surprisingly homogenous. 
Hungarian-German compounding but with frequent use of apostrophes to denote movement, age, chronology, ownership. Most names for things are short phrases.
Word Examples: T’Lukan - moving into/ toward the sky; K’Nara - moving down into the mountain.
Language influences: Klingon, Congalease, Bantu 

### Gazat (Ĝẑt)
Major language of the Northern States of Gazu: Gazumbar, Dum Gazat, Buckler mountains,etc. Gazat can be explained by tracing the history of human, elven, gnomish and goblinoid settlements in the region. A proto-gazat was almost certainly widely spoken in the area before the gnomi-modified gundani script was introduced. Though artifacts are rare, they indicate that much of the area used a complex syllabary likely descended from Yagkuuna. However the gnomish diaspora from Zidan radically changed the language and the script was entirely restructured over time by the gnomes who added the vowel-indicator accents from their scrollwork (to reduce page length) and introduced myriad Zidatan nomenclature.
Language influences: Romani and Bosnian, old-norse

### D​ruvYk
​Common language of the Southern states of Gazu: Umbar, and Arnakyr island. All evidence suggests that DruvYk was initially very close to the original proto-Gazat languages spoken to the north; however, the incursion of the Munar (Munaeꝡrn) introduced much change with raiding and new settlements. 
Example words: Gundarkyvos, Ænuugynta, Kulu’nyvos, Zyros
Language influences: Romani and Bosnian, old-norse

### Yagkuuna
Common goblin language of southern Khudan islands. Lingua Franca of the Aongh and the city state of Ulangatun. Quite a difficult and complex language composed of a large syllabary with upwards of 25 characters exclusively for vowel sounds alone and an additional 200 representing consonant vowel combinations reversals of which represent a phonological reversal of vowel consonant position. Syllables are also placed higher or lower relative to a median line to represent the four tones Yagkuuna along with Grygr are thought to predate Tadrosi and Gundatan due to their highly unique structures. Among the only Kudahn languages with tones and trithongs and a differentiation between long vs short held vowels
Vowels: A, E, I, O, U, AA, EE, II, OO, UU, AO, AI, EO, etc. Consonants: B, G, K, L, N, M, V, Y
Example words: Nyangumarta, Djaru, Wajarr, Noonga, Kuuk Thaayore, Yugambeh-Bundjalung
Language influences:  Aboriginal and Maori languages of Australia and New Sealand, Toki Pona with elements of Thai, languages of Indonesia

### Grygr
The language family of the North, primarily spoken by orcs,  dwarves and some elves. Also the word for the sound of wind through trees and the verb “to speak”. Widespread especially in Ysgr but a high degree of regional fragmentation is present with some dialects unintelligible to each other. Primarily uses its own Logography where each character represents a concept with inclusion of Tadrosi characters for borrowed words. Vowels are not as important to Grygr as other languages so many vowels sounds omitted or turned to Y‘s when written in other scripts
Word Examples: Ysgr, Yzra, Uygr, Udrum, Ysgrynyr
Consonants: D, G, K, L, N, T, R/L, Y, V, Z  Vowels: A, U, Y
Language influences: Kyrgzy, Kazakh,Inuktitut, Inuit sounds - chinese writing style

### Munaeꝡrn
Spoken in northwestern Doran, Munar, and western Ysgr especially islands of the Kalttryt Sea east of Strꝡr
Most similar to Grygr but significantly different due to island isolation.
Language influences: Old-English, scottish icelandic


### Zidatlan
Spoken through Zidan. Uses a highly logical and efficient alphabet system. Which makes Zidatan one of the easiest languages to speak, read, and write. The Gundan language was designed and implemented several thousand years ago and has been maintained through strict laws. Although the language has been exported to Doran and the states of Gazu though simple immigration and trade the lack of regulation has seen it mutated radically outside of its home borders. Although Zidatan script will often be encountered outside of Zidan it is often paired with entirely different languages.
Because High-Zidatan is so tightly regulated the language lacks the subtlety of organic languages which often contain semi-redundant but contextually nuanced structures and vocabulary. Although only High-Gundan is formally taught in schools the populace uses a wide variety of slang terms and colloquialisms leading to something of a double language particularly amongst non-native speakers. As a result most art is created and performed in Low-Zidatan

## Kudahros and the Kudahr Field
#### Alar Shay,  M.A.P. Department of Arcanics,  Ulangatun Athenaeum
### Abstract
Our Everyday experience  in traditional spacetime (three spatial and single time dimension), tells us that information is stored using Energy and Mass (E-M). Consciousness is an emergent property of information manifesting from particular organizational structures of that same information-- e.g. consciousness carries more information than can be reasonably expected of the underlying E-M and evades understanding through the traditional lenses of natural philosophy, geomancy, and arcanics.
Here we propose that consciousness exists as a dynamic interplay between an extra-dimensional force-field and our traditional , lower-dimensional world. We refer to this extradimensional force as the "Kudahr Field" and elaborate on it's properties and uses.

### The Kudahr Field and Consciousness
The Kudahr field is an extradimensional information field capable of reducing the state inertia of the energy-matter-information trinity: i.e. EMI-flux. Kudahr field interactions with lower-dimensional spacetime are most commonly observed as consciousness: In conscious beings, lower-dimensional E-M (physiology and anatomy) and it's coupled information (neural-network electrochemistry) is organized such that extradimensional information can be "stored" and "retrieved" from the Kudahr field at will. In other words information is organized  in the brain such that the Kudahr field is affected and the Kudahr field in turn effects the E-M-I of the brain.

In this instance, lower-dimensional E-M-I is only effected by the Kudahr force through the conscious thoughts of the sentient being--a limited scope akin to magnets' attractive effect on a smattering of ferromagnetic substances alone. However, sufficiently elevated states of consciousness are able to effectively broaden the Kudahr force reorganizing the E-M-I of lower dimensional spacetime through the Kudahr field.

The Kudahr field is not spread evenly over our lower-dimensional universe and areas of comparatively high EMI-flux (high ambient field strength) are known as Loci. Achieving Kudahr field super-conciousness is seemingly much easier in Loci but more more difficult in field-strength minimum zones.

### Teleportation:
Teleportation involves a total conversion of lower-dimensional E-M-I to Kudahr field super-information in a way which ensures its reconversion back to lower-dimensional E-M-I. This process is intensely difficult and requires an uncommon mastery over the Kudahr field. Because the Kudahr field is extra-dimensional distant points in lower dimensions may be comparatively close in Kudahr-field space and proximate lower-dimensional points may be separated by unknown distances in Kudahr field space.

​Three factors govern the difficulty of teleportation. 1. The proximity of the point in traditional space-time. 2. The ambient Kudahr-field strength at the point of departure and arrival. 3. the familiarity with the location and it's proximal Kudahr field E-M-I flux patterns.
